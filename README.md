# splatoonhackinghub.github.io
Source code for the S.H.H., which contains resources to learn and develop Splatoon hacking. From basic Param edits to advanced imgui menus, SHH is filled with people like me, who likes to do things that Nintendo doesn't want us to do. Made by kirakira (crediting: if you used this website and liked it, maybe you could spread the word?)
